# Digit-Recognition
A digit recognition project using an artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning project that involves training a model to recognize and classify handwritten digits, such as those found in the MNIST dataset. The ANN is trained on a dataset of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels (e.g. "0", "1", "2", etc.). Once trained, the model can then be used to classify new, unseen images of handwritten digits. The project typically involves several stages, such as preprocessing the input data, designing the architecture of the ANN, training the model, and evaluating the performance. Additionally, the model can be further improved by experimenting with different architectures, optimization algorithms and regularization techniques.
